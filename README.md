# Project_1

## Description

We would like to develop a website that will let the user enter a famous athlete in the search bar and obtain that players team and stats. Our web page will primarly generate information about the athletes current team, positin and name. We also want to include a section of pop up links per player that will allow the user to access athelets awards, accomplishments biography and highlights of their carrers. For now, we will mainly focus on having two sport sections; American Basketball (NBA) and American Baseball (MLB).

* To use this site you must select a sport from the dropdown menu before typing a name into the search bar. If you do not select a player sport the page will not return any information.
